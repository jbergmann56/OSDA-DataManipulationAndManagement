 and employee number 110039 as a manager to all employees from 10021 to 10040 (this must be subset B).

Use the structure of subset A to create subset C, where you must assign employee number 110039 as a manager to employee 110022.

Following the same logic, create subset D. Here you must do the opposite - assign employee 110022 as a manager to employee 110039.
