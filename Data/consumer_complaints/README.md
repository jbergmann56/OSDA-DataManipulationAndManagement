# Consumer Complaints

This data is from [here](http://www.superdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ConsumerComplaints.csv). I learned of it from a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/sqldatabases/) course I completed, by Kirill Eremenko. The full dataset is [here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/#download-the-data). The data is from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website.
